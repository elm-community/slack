## General

- Avoid threads in main discussions channels This isn't a hard rule, and threads can be super helpful, but it's better to default to keeping chat in the channel when possible. It helps everyone see the conversations.
- If the discussion is about a particular library or problem, a slack channel dedicated may be worthwhile, if the conversations are long.

## Channels

On the Elmlang Slack, we try to keep discussions in the right place. Deciding where the right place for something is often quite difficult, but these are some rules I try to follow:

- **#general** is a channel that _everyone_ has to be part of. In order to be wary of that, it's important to keep things focused on Elm there. Other discussions about things unrelated to Elm directly should go to #random.
- If you need help, go to **#admin-help**. We can help you out with any problems. Otherwise, you can PM an admin.
- **#news-and-links** should be for sharing links only -- take discussions to other channels, or use threads 
- Keep posts on jobs in **#jobs**, and make sure your description states location, remote-friendly, language, and a link to your site. Keep things in tl;dr format.
- Long help threads should go to #help. 
- **#beginners** is intended for learning questions - questions about native/kernal code or more complex aspects of Elm should go to **#help** or **#general**.
- **#elm-dev** is intended for discussion on how to implement complex things with Elm, or the internals of how Elm works. For example, lots of questions were asked there during the implementation of Ellie. 
- **#package-design** is intended for helping people to write better packages
- **#random** is intended for discussions about anything not Elm related. Generally, avoid anything NSFW related -- there are people of all ages on the Slack group. Please also avoid topics that tend to start flamewars, such as politics or religion. This is not the place to discuss such things.

### New Channels

The creation of new channels has been limited to admins only. If you have a reason for a new channel, please ask in #admin-help. There might already be a channel that's appropriate for what you want! If you do end up getting a new channel, please invite @archivebot right away so that there can be a publicly searchable history for future reference.


## Jobs

- Keep your job post to tl;dr format. Don't go on and on - keep things short and concise.
- Keep conversation in the #jobs channel focused on jobs.
- Job posts should be for positions that involve using Elm.

### Posting a Job
- The first line should begin with `| <company name> | <location + remote friendly> | <job title> |`
- The admins usually pin job postings that are formatted that way
- If the position gets filled, please notify an admin so that we can unpin the posting

### Seeking Work
- The first line should begin with `| seeking work | <location / willing to relocate> | <brief skills & description of what kind of work is being sought>`
